Motivation

Earth’s atmospheric temperature is changing rapidly. The global warming, climate change & impact on ocean are quite familiar terms globally. But all the temperature changes are impacting rain cycle and there by our agriculture, quality of soil, food, air and seasons as well. Hence, my motivation behind this topic is to collect the data, understand it, visualize it to understand greenhouse gases & its impact. 
I actively participated in world's largest save soil movement in 2022 and I came across few facts about human activities and how they are impacting all the natural resources as well as living beings on the planet. So, my primary inspiration comes from this passion to know more about planet's current condition and how we all contribute to it in many ways.

Questions

Some key questions this project will look at and attempt to answer :
What is the Greenhouse effect?
What are greenhouse gases? Are they bad?
What is climate change?
What is global warming?
What are the sources of greenhouse gas effects & how human activities cause more greenhouse gases?

Normalizing The Data

The United States Environmental Protection Agency website has all the data about green house gas emission. (only US). My data consists of years from 1990 to 2023. I used various analysis approach to find green house gas emission over years, trends & the main sources of green house gases. The states which have maximum greenhouse gas emission. Then later, I am focusing on year 2020 where pandemic impact can be seen on greenhouse gases effects. 

Problems & Hurdles

The data did not need much cleaning, but it was a vast data. The understanding of the few topics in detail and some calculations were required to establish greenhouse gas emission visualizations by each state, sector and various subsectors. 

Technologies Used

To create analysis and visualization my major work was in Python. I also used Power BI for geospatial data and Tableau to create dashboard.

Conclusion

The conclusion of greenhouse gas emissions is that increased levels of these gases in the atmosphere, primarily caused by human activities, trap more heat from the sun, leading to a warming planet and resulting climate change, with potential consequences like rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disrupted ecosystems.
Awareness & conscious living will not only reverse the damage but also help government an UN to create better policies to protect planet & its environment
